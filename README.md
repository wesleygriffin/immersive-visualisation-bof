### Immersive Analytics BoF at SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 

This BOF focuses on Immersive Analytics which is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces, deployed through effective use of immersive systems including desktop VR and WebVR. The goals applied to scientific visualization enable scientists to understand, explore and gain meaningful insights from their massive data, often outcomes of complex simulations or data captures. It presents novel opportunities to facilitate data exploration with a human-in-the-loop using combination of machine learning, high performance graphics and interactive visualizations, and combining the strengths of human intuition with the power of computing to enhance better decision making.
